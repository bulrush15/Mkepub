Make EPUB2 ebook files from MultiMarkdown text files. e-book, e-reader, ereader

## What is Mkepub? 

Mkepub is a tool to convert MultiMarkdown files along with CSS files and images, 
into a real EPUB2 book. [MultiMarkdown info here](https://rawgit.com/fletcher/human-markdown-reference/master/index.html).

Markdown is easy for beginners. It uses less characters to format text, so your
text is more easily readable. You only need a text editor to make a Markdown file. I suggest the free and very good PSPad at http://www.pspad.com. 

These MultiMarkdown features have been tested with Mkepub: lists, links, images, CSS,  footnotes and more. 

It supports these special tags in the content.opf file: Author, Title, ISBN10, ISBN13, and/or a unique ID, Publisher, Original publication date, EPUB date, Source, multiple Subjects. Right now it needs Info-zip to run. Links are in the 00readme.md file, duplicated in 00readme.htm as HTML. This is freeware, not shareware, not crippleware. 

These additional XHTML tags have also been tested: &lt;big&gt;, &lt;del&gt;, &lt;dl&gt;, &lt;dd&gt;, &lt;dt&gt;,
&lt;ins&gt;, &lt;small&gt;. 

Table tags tested: table, caption, th, tr, td. All tags must be closed properly.

I've already used this to make 5+ ebooks which pass validation.

"Markdown" is used interchangably with "MultiMarkdown", but the real meaning is MultiMarkdown.
